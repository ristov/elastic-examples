This repository provides some example configuration files for combining
Filebeat, Logstash, rsyslog, Redis, and Elasticsearch, so that messages can be
sent from Filebeat to Elasticsearch.

Note that these configuration files have been tested with Elastic Stack 
version 7.16.3 and rsyslog version 8.2202.0.


For implementing Filebeat->Redis->rsyslog->Elasticsearch message flow,
have a look into the following configuration files:

filebeat-output.yml
rsyslog-redisbeat2elastic.conf


For implementing Filebeat->Logstash->Elasticsearch message flow,
have a look into the following configuration files:

filebeat-output.yml
logstash-beat2elastic.conf


For implementing Filebeat->Logstash->rsyslog->Elasticsearch message flow,
have a look into the following configuration files:

filebeat-output.yml
logstash-beat2syslog.conf
rsyslog-syslogbeat2elastic.conf
